## Task

We are building a checkout system for an online electronics store owner. The checkout system needs to do the following:

### Store owner
- Create a new product
- Amend the price/description of a product
- Remove a product
- Apply discount deals for products (eg buy 1 get 50% off the second)
- Apply bundle deals (eg buy 1 laptop, get a mouse for free)
  
### Checkout:
- Add product to basket
- Amend quantity of product in a basket
- Remove product from basket
- Calculate total price and products taking into account all discounts and bundles

### Out of scope:
- Logging
- Continuous Integration
- Deployment
- Metrics
